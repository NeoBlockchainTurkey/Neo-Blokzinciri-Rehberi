# NEO Blockchain Quick Start Guide for .NET Developers

NEO Blockchain Documentation for .NET Developers ([url](https://github.com/mwherman2000/neo-windocs/tree/master/windocs))

## Activity 1 - Download and install Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition integrated development environment (IDE)

### Purpose

The purpose of this activity is to download, install and perform basic configuration Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition if you don't already have an existing version of Visual Studio 2017 installed.

### Goals, Non-Goals and Assumptions

* Ensure you have a working and properly configured version of Visual Studio 2017 installed

Any additional Visual Studio customization steps are decribed in subsequent activities.

Visual Studio 2017 will install side-by-side with previous versions/editions of Visual Studio without affecting them (other than reducing your free disk space). This includes Visual Studio 2015 and Visual Studio Code, etc.

### Principles

* Provide reliable documentation: timely, accurate, visual, and complete
* Save as much of a person's time as possible
* Use open source software whenever possible

### Drivers

* Need in the NEO .NET developer community to have concise and easy-to-follow documentation to enable people to get up to speed developing NEO smart contracts in as short a time as possible

## Download and install Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition integrated development environment (IDE)

There are 2 scenarios:
* Scenario 1 - You don't have any version of Visual Studio 2017 installed
* Scenario 2 - You have an existing verson of Visual Studio 2017 installed

If Scenario 1 applies to you, you need to perform the tasks in Scenario 1 and then skip Scenario 2.

If only scenario 2 applies to you, you can skip the tasks in Scenario 1 and only perform the tasks in Scenario 2.

In addition, it is quite useful to have the Visual Studio Code installed on your computer. The installation and configuration of Visual Studio Code is documented as Scenario 3 and is optional but recommended.
